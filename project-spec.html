        <p class="title">Description of Project: A game in which the user's objective is to catch falling objects -- at first unaware of their effects on points. As the game continues, the user should realize what the effect of each object is and attempt to earn the highest score based on the random genertion of 20 items.</p>
        <p class="title">Team Members: Sophie Madjarova and Rohaid Bakheet, classes/Objects: used to define the concept of a CoconutLikeObject with properties calling to the specific image/number assigned to the coconut
            also including a constructor,if/ then else statements: used to set up hit boxes, scoring criteria, etc, for/while loops: used to control the timing/generation of coconuts </p>
        <p class="title">Challenges Overcome / New Concepts Learned: learned how to use functions of pixi js/ how to manipulate a ticker && managed to overcome bugs taht arose as a function of randomly generating the falling objects (ex. falling objects generating in middle of screen/ not disappearing, etc.)</p>

        <p class="title">Groupwork(Individual Contributions to the Project)<p>
                <p class="title">   Rohaid Bakheet: illustrations, generation of coconuts to fall down the screen by assigning direction, set-up of the ticker, debugging<p>
                <p class="title">   Sophie Madjarova: html and formatting (+ awesome choice of music), motion of main character based on keyboard event, updating of point values and creation of hit boxes, debugging<p>
        <p class="title">Goals Achieved: We managed to set up the main character and the falling objects and to create a template for interaction between the character and the specific type of 
                falling object.<p>
        <p class="title">Goals Outstanding + Future Work: To make the game more fun, it is necessary that more than one example of each type of coconut is generated (i.e. more than 4 objects drop). Unfortunately, this was a problem we did not have time to fix. Furthermore, we were interested in adding an easter egg where if a user clicks on the sun, a pokeball falls (faster than the other objects) and has a great point incentive or maybe causes the page to redirect/play different music.   <p>
